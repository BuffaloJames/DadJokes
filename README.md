# Dad Joke Generator

## Background
I don't get to see my kids every day, so I text them a greeting and dad joke every morning. I couldn't keep track of all of the jokes, so I originally started writing them into a master list of jokes. Then, I categorized them so I could tell seasonal jokes. Eventually, my kids asked for an app on their home computer to get more dad jokes. This all grew from me trying to make my kids smile every morning. :)

## Functionality
There are two files.
The txt file contains the dad jokes and their categories. Each joke is in a separate row with the categories following the joke.
The py file contains the app. The app has the following features:
- Users can select a category and receive a joke from that category. The app will show the joke on the screen and speak it.
- Users can use keywords to search for jokes.
- Users can ask for a seasonal joke. The py file contains a list of holidays or seasons. If today's date is near that event, then that category of jokes is available using the Seasonal Joke button.
- Users can add their jokes to a list of favorites and view that list.
- Users can respond with an emoji,
- Users can change the color theme.
- When users exit, the app will say a silly goodbye. 

There is also an admin panel with the following functionality.
- Users can view jokes and change the assigned categories.
- Users can see counts of jokes by category.
- Users can change the theme colors.
- Users can add and categorize their own jokes.
